  <p><a href="index.html">Play game.</a></p>
  <p>After some playing around you will come to the realization that if there
  are an odd number of boards, the first player can force a win and if there are
  an even number of boards, the second player can do so.  The computer plays a
  winning move if one exists and otherwise plays randomly.  Therefore, when
  playing with an even number of boards one should always force the computer to
  take the first move.</p>

  <p>The strategies are best learned by starting small and building up, i.e.,
  getting to the point at which one can always win on a single board and then
  learn to win on two boards no matter what the computer's first move is and
  then generalize to three, four...</p>
